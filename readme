# Project NILM 
Nonintrusive Load Monitoring, nonintrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM), or energy disaggregation is a process for analyzing changes in the voltage and current going into a house and deducing what appliances are used in the house as well as their individual energy consumption.

# Contains
Documents - all research papers and link regarding NILM project 
Data_files - csv and parquet files used in this project
Code - pipelines and code

# data ingestion
- csv file reeading to pandas DataFrames (12 files [2 mains and 10 appliances]).
- timestamp conversionn from unix to general yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss .
- pandas DataFrame to parquet file  ( mains + appliances with complete data ).
- reading parquet files of 4 appliances (fridge, ac, washing machine, tv).
- timeframe for all appliances 2023/06/12 to 2023/06/21 (or 2023/08/04).
- #(optional) perticular timeframed data into parquet file.

# cleaning and validation
- null value check, total count of data, special characters check, duplicates.
- active power is greator than apparent power that why for active power we used voltage*current*PF.
- validation order frequency -> current -> pf -> voltage -> active > aparent -> power =  voltage*current*PF.
